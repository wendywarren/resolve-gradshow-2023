  I am Holly Drew, a graduate of Algonquin College’s graphic design program with
  a diploma in professional writing and four years of experience in visual
  communications. From advocating for nature conservation, strengthening
  Canada’s healthcare system, and building youth socio-economic wellness, I’ve
  used my skills as a communicator to further causes I care about deeply. In my
  work, I strive to be audience-centric, accessible and consistent. While I love
  all aspects of graphic design, I am mostly looking forward to developing my
  experience in web design, UX/UI and print.
