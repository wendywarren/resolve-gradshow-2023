  Hello, my name is Stacey Johnstone! I am a First Nations Anishinaabe kwe and a
  proud member of the Chippewas of Kettle and Stony Point. I have a strong love
  for illustration, motion graphics, and visually communicating ideas to raise
  awareness towards positive change.  My hobbies and interests include playing
  video games, watching professional wrestling, beadwork, strawberries,
  exploring new foods and genres of music, as well as caring for my overall
  wellbeing.
