  Hey there, I'm Delphine. I love all sorts of design, but my main focuses are
  branding, illustration, and package design â€“ with a sprinkle of motion! Fun
  fact: before working as a designer, I graduated art school with a specialty in
  printmaking (and I still try to sneak it into my design practice where I can).
  I love bad movies, cats, 90s rock, and all things spooky!
